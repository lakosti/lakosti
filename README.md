# Fullstack 🚀

I'm a junior frontend developer exploring the universe of fullstack development. This stack combines the power of **React.js** on the frontend with the flexibility of **Node.js** on the backend. 

# 🎯 Current mission: Find the bug before the bug finds me.
# 🌐 When I’m not coding, I’m probably debugging my life decisions.

## Tech Stack 📦

### Frontend:
- **React.js**
- **Redux / Redux Toolkit**
- **React Router**
- **Axios / Fetch API**
- **Formik + Yup**
- **TypeScript**

### Backend:
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB + Mongoose**
- **JWT**
- **Bcrypt**

### Database Options:
- **MongoDB** (Primary)
- **Firebase** (For quick prototyping)

## Why This Stack? 🤔
I built this stack to learn and grow as a fullstack developer. It's modern, versatile, and fun to work with. Each tool and library is chosen to balance simplicity and power, so I can deliver great features while keeping the code clean and maintainable. Plus, it’s a lot of fun to debug when things don’t work (who doesn’t love a good challenge?). 😅

## Let’s Build Something Awesome! ✨
If you're reading this, you're probably as excited about fullstack development as I am. Let’s collaborate, share ideas, and make cool stuff together! 💡
